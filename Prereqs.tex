\section{Chapter 2}

Important points to remember:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $x_0 \in \mathfrak{h}$ be the unique element given by $\langle \alpha_i, x_0 \rangle = 1$ for all $i$ so that 
    $\langle \phi, x_0 \rangle = o(\phi)$ for all $\phi \in \mathfrak{g}$.
  \item Let $S_{(i)}(\mathfrak{\overline b}) = \bigoplus_{j+k=i} (S_k(\mathfrak{\overline b}))_j$ similarly put 
    $U_{(i)}(\mathfrak{\overline b}) = \sum_{j+k=i} (U_k(\mathfrak{\overline b}))_j$.
  \item What are $S_k(\mathfrak{g})^G$ and $S_{(k)}(\mathfrak{b})^N$?
      $N \subseteq G$ is the unipotent Lie subgroup correesponding to $\mathfrak{n} \subseteq \mathfrak{g}$.
      $S(\mathfrak{g})^G$ is the set of $G$-invariant elements of $S(\mathfrak{g})$ (by the adjoint action?).
\end{itemize}
